      <h2>Capela dos Ossos (Chapel of Bones)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The “Chapel of Bones” is a small interior chapel located next to the entrance of the Igreja de Sao Francisco (Church of St Francis) that was built in the 16th century by Franciscan friars. It gets its name because the interior walls are covered
          and decorated with human skulls and bones.</li>
        <li>The number of skeletons was calculated to be about 5000, coming from the cemeteries that were situated inside several dozen churches.</li>
        <li>The idea came from one of the Franciscan friars who wanted to prod his fellow brothers into contemplation and transmit the message of life being transitory, a very common spirituality theme summed up in the motto memento mori. </li>
        <li>At the entrance there is a famous warning: “Nos ossos que aqui estamos pelos vossos esperamos” (“We bones that are here, for yours await”).</li>
